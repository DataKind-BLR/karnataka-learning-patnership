# [Karnataka Learning Partnership](https://klp.org.in/)
The Karnataka Learning Partnership is a non-profit organization working in the education sector. They are trying to help develop a better education platform for children by collecting data through surveys and competition and bring a clearer picture of the current system.

## How [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org/) is helping Karnataka Learning Partnership:

KLP holds competition at a Gram Panchayat Level and conducts community surveys with questions to parents about the school and what they think their child knows about the subjects. In addition to this KLP also combines their data with [DISE](http://udise.in/) data, under DISE the government of India collects data of each active school nationwide and contains information about the infrastructure, student ratio, grants, teachers etc. of each school.

We are dealing with 3 data sources : -

    1. Community Feedback
    2. Gram Panchayat Contest Data
    3. DISE

The goal of the sprint is data analysis and looking for opportunities to build predictive dashboards given the above data sources.
