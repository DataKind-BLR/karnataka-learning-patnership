# [Karnataka Learning Partnership](https://klp.org.in/)
The Karnataka Learning Partnership is a non-profit organization working in the education sector. They are trying to help develop a better education platform for children by collecting data through surveys and competition and bring a clearer picture of the current system.

## The Data
KLP holds competition at a Gram Panchayat Level and conducts community surveys with questions to parents about the school and what they think their child knows about the subjects. In addition to this KLP also combines their data with [DISE](http://udise.in/) data, under DISE the government of India collects data of each active school nationwide and contains information about the infrastructure, student ratio, grants, teachers etc. of each school.

We are dealing with 3 data sources : -

    1. Community Feedback
    2. Gram Panchayat Contest Data
    3. DISE

## How [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org/) is helping Karnataka Learning Partnership:

1. Building Visualization Dashboards to easily digest the information. We will be setting up [superset](https://github.com/ApacheInfra/superset).
   Superset is a flexible data exploration tool, that allows users to create, save and share dashboards and also download csv files. It does require some
   basic knowledge of SQL. It also has connectors for a lot of Databases already built upon, which makes it a very mature tool to explore and build upon.

2. Data Analysis and Insights. Exploring how the data can be combined at different levels and how each school/gram panchayat/block/district can be compared.
   Insights related to performance of schools/students

3. Exploration of feasible performance indicators to predict performance of schools, based on the data provided.
