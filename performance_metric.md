# Performance Metrics

To measure the performance at student level and school level we added performance_score column as a performance metric to compare Gram Panchayats, Blocks and Districts.


	_ ** performance_score = (Total Score / (child_count * number_of_questions)) ** _


By assuming each question carries 1 mark. The score remains between 0 to 1 which helps to plot proper graphs and make dashboards.

Itâ€™s basically generic score which helps to filter data at smaller level to larger level, which helps in fine tuning the comparison and eventually making dashboard more sensible, comparative and interactive.
